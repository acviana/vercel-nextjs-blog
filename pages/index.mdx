# Alex C. Viana

Hey, thanks for stopping by. I'm a Data [Analyst|Scientist|Engineer|Leader]. This blog is a notebook of little ideas I find interesting. 

I've found my sweet spot for getting my ideas out the door is about 100 words, just long enough to make a single focused point.
Anything longer and it's a slipper slope of scope creep and perfectionism into a sparwling manifesto. 
To keep things interesting, I like to end my posts with a little cultural footnote.

Hope you enjoy it,

\- acv
