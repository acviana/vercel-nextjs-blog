The Moving Target Pipeline group at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland seeks a graduate or undergraduate student for a paid summer internship through the Institute's Space Astronomy Summer Program (SASP). The intern will work with our group to develop, test, and run our software pipeline which processes Solar System object observations ("moving targets") taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Moving Target Pipeline is the first attempt in the 22-year history of the Hubble Space Telescope to create a generalized data processing pipeline to meet the unique requirements of Solar System data. Using Python and MySQL the pipeline creates calibrated science data, dynamically scaled preview images, and predicts possible detections of "incidental" or serendipitous objects such as moons and asteroids. These data products and software techniques are of broad interest to the solar system research community as well as STScI, even influencing plans for the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). More information on the project can be found [here](http://acviana.github.io/posts/2013/mtpipeline-ddrf/).

This is an ideal opportunity for a student interested in software development, whose goal is either a career in software or wishes to add programming to his or her highly-desirable skill set. Our intern will be exposed to many aspects of professional software development including documentation, testing, code reviews, distributed version control, and remote software execution. Last year's intern in our group (a college senior) reported the internship experience helpful in both job interviews and subsequently, on the job.

Strong candidates for this position will have experience in:

 * Working in the Linux command line  
 * The Python programming language  
 * SQL databases, specifically MySQL  
 * Version control, specifically Git and GitHub  

A demonstrated ability to work and learn independently as well as attention to detail are all valued. A background in astronomy or physics is desirable but not required. Applicants with other relevant qualifications, such as experience in other programming languages or success in prior internships, are encouraged to demonstrate how they could contribute to our work.

Candidates are invited apply by follow this [link](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/smo/students/applications). Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply. The deadline for applications is January 31st, 2014.

Please note that all applications go into a general applicant pool and will be considered for _all_  internship opportunities available through the SASP. If you are specifically interested in an internship with our Moving Target project please include the words "Moving Target" somewhere in your application to ensure our group reviews your application.

We look forward to your application,
