This is week 3 of my weekly sabbatical summaries. I finally feel like I hit a grove where I can knock one of these out as quickly as I would like. The most exiting update this week is that I got to do some hands-on work for some companies in addition to my self-study and side projects.

I continue to get feedback and TOOD about these so please continue reaching out!

This week I started doing some hands-on work helping 2 companies with some technical work while giving advice on creating data driven product decisions to a third. On the job front I spoke to some interesting local companies and some more VCs. While I'm ultimately looking for a full time role I'm lucky to be at a stage in my career where I can just enjoy the conversations and the connections.

Math: Not wanting to completely skip working on any math this weekend I'm working on a proof of the Binomial Theorem TODO:Link. I think I have the shape of the proof but I just need to figure out how to TODO. As always, I struggle with deciding when I've reached the point of diminished returns on trying to work through these on my own. Next problem starts a series of Fibonacci related questions I'm looking forward to.

### Web Scrapping

I wrote a quick web scrapper for a friends company to help them gather content for a customer demo. I was fun to return the stuff I used to do nearly a decade ago when I was working for a company scraping the Dark Web for information security purposes. I originally started the project in scrapy TODO: Link which is a nice structured crawling and scraping framework. But this started to feel like overkill for the task and so I wrote a simpler script using just request and BeautifulSoup TODO: Link. This was pretty quick work and ChatGTP helped out a lot by giving the me HTML tag queries.

### Prompt engineering

I started helping a pre-seed founder with some generative AI prompt engineering and QA validation. The context is medical document summarization to accelerate TODO. While I've been using generative AI both locally and via ChatGPT for a nearly a year this is TODO.

### Odds and Ends

I made a little bit of progress on the bookmark tool project, mostly small updates to the queries and started pushing data up to MotherDuck.

I've been using Neovim casually for most of 2024. But, as I've been telling folks, watching me use Neovim is like watching a caveman trying to rub two Teslas together to make fire. I'm slowly getting better at learnin the key mappings and installing the extensions I need but what I really need to do is rip off the bandaid and start customizing my setup.

I've been using my current blog setup for about 2 years now. Which, if you have a blog you know means I'm getting the itch to rip it out and start over (and then blog about that). So I've spent a little time trying out different frameworks to see what else is out there.
