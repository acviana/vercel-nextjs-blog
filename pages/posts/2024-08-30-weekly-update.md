This is the 3rd time writting a weekly sabbatical summary. This week started to feel more like the quick and direct wriring process I'm hoping to cultivate. As with weeks past, I continue to be plesently surprised by the amout of engagement I get on my posts. Thank you for reading and please say hello.

The most exiting update this week is that I got to do some hands-on work for some companies in addition to my self-study and side projects (this could be you next week). If you need a soundtrack while you read Chance the Rapper snuck one more summer single out before Labor Day. TODO: Link.

This week I started doing some hands-on coding helping 2 companies with some technical work while giving advice on creating data driven product decisions to a third. On the job front I spoke to some interesting local companies and some more VCs. While I'm ultimately looking for a full time role I'm lucky to be at a stage in my career where I can just enjoy the conversations and the connections.

### Web Scrapping

I wrote a one-off web scrapper for a friend's company to help them gather content for a customer demo. I started my career in startups working for a security compny that ran a larger dark web scrapper so it was fun to return to that problem space for a few hours. I originally started the project in [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) which is a nice structured crawling and scraping framework. But Scrapy started to feel like overkill for the task and so I wrote a simpler script using just requests and [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This was pretty quick work and ChatGTP helped out a lot by giving the me HTML tag queries.

### Prompt engineering

I started helping a pre-seed founder with some generative AI prompt engineering and QA validation. The context is medical document summarization to accelerate TODO. While I've been using generative AI both locally and via ChatGPT for a nearly a year this is the first time getting to do so for a commericial use-case.

### Math and CS

Math: Not wanting to completely skip working on any math this weekend I'm working on a proof of the Binomial Theorem TODO:Link. I think I have the shape of the proof but I just need to figure out how to TODO. As always, I struggle with deciding when I've reached the point of diminished returns on trying to work through these on my own. Next problem starts a series of Fibonacci related questions I'm looking forward to.

I didn't get to any LeetCode this week but that was the trade off for doing more coding than usual.

### Odds and Ends

**Bookmarking Tool:** I made a little bit of progress on the bookmark tool project, mostly small updates to the queries and started pushing data up to MotherDuck. TODO: Link

**Neovim:** I've been using Neovim casually for most of 2024. But, as I've been telling folks, watching me use Neovim is like watching a caveman trying to rub two Teslas together to make fire. I'm slowly getting better at learnin the key mappings and installing the extensions I need but what I really need to do is rip off the bandaid and start customizing my setup.

**Blog Framework:** I've been using my current blog setup for about 2 years now. Which, if you have a blog you know means I'm getting the itch to rip it out and start over (and then blog about that). So I've spent a little time trying out different frameworks to see what else is out there.
