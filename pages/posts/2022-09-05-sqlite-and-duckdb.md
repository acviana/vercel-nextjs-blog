I recently came across a [great blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/1/sqlite-duckdb-paper/) by Simon Willison (creator of [Datasette](https://datasette.io/)) digging into a recent academic paper comparing OLAP workloads on SQLite against DuckDB.

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is a newer file-based database that's generating a lot of buzz and is nicknamed "the SQLite for analytics".

If you're into that sort of thing you should check out the [original paper](https://vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/15/paper/SQLite%3A%20Past%2C%20Present%2C%20and%20Future). 
It's pretty readible and gives an overview of SQLite's history, architecture, OLAP benchmarks, bottlenecks, and potential optimizations.

I love this type of well-organized reserach and I feel like I've learned a lot more about my favorite database even though I'm only 1/3 of the way through the paper.

Thanks for reading and please enjoy [this wonderful Georgia O'Keeffe's painting](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100858/sky-above-clouds-iv) that has moved me tears before.
