I'm coming off an 11-day break for the winter holidays. 
I came into the holidays this year really run down and needing a break. 
But weirdly, one of the things I did to recharge from my job working with computers all day was ... tinkering with and maintaining various computers in my house.
I have 3 different generations of MacBooks in my house but I spent most of my time on my favorite machine, a 9 year old ThinkPad X1 Carbon running Ubuntu.

I worked on everything from updating software, installing new utilities, tweaking custom GUI aesthetics, fixing nagging warning messages, and fiddling with configuration files. 
It was a nice change of pace from my work life where I have to prioritize efficiency over say, getting a mouse pointer size just right.

It was also a nice reminder that ever since I was a kid I have loved computers for their own sake.
Not just for building useful stuff, I just enjoy the act of working on them, even in the absence of a project.
There's something very rewarding to me about taking a system that's nearly a decade old and getting it to be almost as nice to work on as the MacBook M1 Pro I use for work.

Happy new year and I hope we all get to do more of the things that make us happy in 2023.

To start of the year with some festive energy please enjoy Masayoshi Takanaka's [samba cover of the Star Wars theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGm_X6viE0A). 
It's completely irreverent, wildly fun, and so much better than it has any right to be.
