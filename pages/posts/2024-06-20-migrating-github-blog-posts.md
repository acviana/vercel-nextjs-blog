Over the years I've written about tech in 4 places. A tumblr (I'm old), a GitHub pages blog, a substack, and now this blog. For a long time I wanted to collect all my writing in one place. I've finally started that project by porting all TODO posts from my long dormant Github Pages blog.

These posts start around 2013 when I was still working for the Hubble Space Telescope and some of my astronomy pipelines and analysis projects I was working on. They end in 2017 when I had a leadership position at a tech startup to some of the deeper dives I was  I still need to clean up some links and images but the content is ready to go. You can find all the posts under the `#github-blog` tag.
