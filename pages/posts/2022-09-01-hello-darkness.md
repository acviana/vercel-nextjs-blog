I figured out how to turn on a "dark mode" toggle. 
It's [somewhat buried in the docs](https://nextra.vercel.app/themes/blog) but you can add a `darkMode: true` flag in `theme.config.js` to turn this feature on.

I was a little confused at first because the app doesn't default to dark mode, it just adds a sun/moon icon in the upper right the page where you can toggle your color preference.

It's a pretty intense high-contrast dark mode though, which I'm not sure if I like it enough to keep.

But this is a neat little app and I'm enjoying playing with it.
