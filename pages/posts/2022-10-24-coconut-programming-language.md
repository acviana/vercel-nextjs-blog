A friend of mine tipped me off to a neat little project called the [Coconut programming language](https://coconut-lang.org/).
From the docs:

> Coconut is a functional programming language that compiles to Python. Since all valid Python is valid Coconut, using Coconut will only extend and enhance what you're already capable of in Python.

Because I have a math degree and use functions in my Python code I like to pretend I'm a functional programmer (mustache twirl).
However, other than my annual 30-minute attempt to learn Haskell on the first day of Advent of Code and the occasional [Python type hint](https://realpython.com/lessons/type-hinting/) -- I haven't made much progress on that front.

On one hand, I doubt I'll spend much time with Coconut. But on the other, I do think this would be the first project I would reach for now if I wanted to get my hands dirty working in a functional framework.

My last thought here is that this project kind of reminds me of [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/). That effort seems to have [run out of steam](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/coffeescript-6dd64142b8dd) but developers of a certain age will remember it as another Haskell influence language that compiles down to a "mainstream" language.
