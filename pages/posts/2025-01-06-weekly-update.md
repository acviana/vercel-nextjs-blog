Happy new year! I've got a quick and fun post to kick off 2025 about terminal based tools. 

I was chatting with a coworker about the recent iterm2 bug which pulled us into a rabbit hole of terminal-based tools we like. I ended up sending him a bunch of links as we chatted. Afterward I realized I had a pretty useful list so cleaned the list up and shared it on the company Slack. And at that point I realized I had enough for a little blog post.

So what do I look for in a terminal tool? Something I'm big into lately is not having dotfiles and just configuring every system from scratch. This helps git rid of cruft, makes sure I know how my tools work, discard tools I don't use, and discover new ones.

**No config:**

Cool: 

**Terminal Setup**
- [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kittyhttps://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)- Cross-platform, fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal. I switched over from iTerm2 when I realized need the GPU acceleration for LazyVim to feel snappy.
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) - Finally, a command line shell for the 90s!

**Command Line Utilities**
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - A modern alternative to `ls`, I like it for the icons
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A general purpose command-line fuzzy finder that works with linux pipes and has  LazyVim integrations. 
- [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) - A terminal-based resource monitor based on `top` 
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A nicer `cat` clone.

**Development**
- [LaxyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) - IDE-like setup for Neovim
- [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygithttps://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)- A simple terminal UI for git commands, integrates with LazyVim

**Applications**
- [Posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) - Terminal-based Postman alternative
- [Harlequin](https://harlequin.sh/) - Terminal-based SQL IDE
- [Visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) - Terminal-based interactive tool for tabular data. By far the most eccentric tool on this list, like Excel crossed with Vim.

**Bonus**
-  [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual) - Python library for making your own terminal-based applications
