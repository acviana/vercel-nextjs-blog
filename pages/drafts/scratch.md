> Math is just a picture, which you understand, hidden in hieroglyphics. Your job is to turn the hieroglyphics back into a picture.

\- Prof. David Griffeath (UW - Madison)

Since the start of the year I've been working my way through Sheldon Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right". The book describes itself as "a second course in linear algebra" and it takes a more abstract and proof-based approach to the topic than your standard undergraduate course. 

I've really enjoyed this approach, both for the sake of building intuition with the source material, as well as an opportunity to improve my somewhat shaky proof-writing skills from my undergraduate Math degree.

The best way I could describe how my brain "works" is that I can't understand the trees until I can see the forest.

Chapter 1 of "Linear Algebra Done Right"

I recently finished studying chapter 1 of "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler. The books TODO problems took me 4 months to finish. It's been one of the most rewarding intellectual exercises in my post-college life.

The 3 sections that comprise the first chapter would have been covered in about ~2 weeks in a typical college course. A major part of my enjoyment came from my ability to move at my own pace and devote as much time as I needed to topics until I felt like I understood concepts "in my bones". This led to numerous side-quests such as:

- Returning to Spivak to check the properties of continuous or differential functions
- Reading TODO until I _really_ understood if and only if proofs, converse and contrapositive statements.
- Trying my hand at reading my first math paper to get close to understanding the only problem I skipped.

LADR is an upper-level undergraduate text that takes more algebraic and proof-based approach to teaching linear algebra. Commonly, linear algebra is taught in a more applied format focusing on applications and calculation.
